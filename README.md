A junior full-stack developer with four years experience working with some the world's most innovative technology brands in a non-technical role. I combine a strong background in communication and team management, with technical skills and a passion for technology to create code that is clean, efficient and adaptable.

I'm currently looking for my next challenge within the UK's tech scene, to build my skills in full-stack development and help create the next generation of tech for good.

## Skills

* <b>Agile Development</b> - Experience using agile methodologies for project work, developing user requirements incrementally in short sprints.
* <b>Test Driven Development</b> - Adept with taking a test driven approach to writing code. Good knowledge of using TDD and using both existing frameworks such as RSpec and Jasmine. I have also built my own testing framework as well as testing using a language's inherent logic.
* <b>Communications</b> - I bring exceptional communication skills, both written and spoken, when dealing with colleagues, clients and external stakeholders. When coding this gives me excellent attention to detail and the ability to explain a brief clearly and concisely.
* <b>Logical and Creative</b> - With a degree in English Literature combined with experience in technology and coding, I bring both creativity and logic to the workplace. Able to blend both disciplines to create solutions which go beyond what is expected, while still meeting the brief.
* <b>Account and Staff Management</b> - Experience working within and leading diverse teams to achieve high targets. Examples include driving Sony Professional Solutions Europe's PR efforts in the UK to achieve monthly coverage targets for over two years, and managing ForeScout's social media campaigns globally with over a 2000% increase on engagement.
* <b>Time Management</b> - Having spent four years within a high-pressured agency environment, typically balancing 6-8 accounts & projects at one time, I am used to closely managing my time. I bring a strong understanding of the importance of meeting deadlines, balancing priorities and delivering exceptional work free from errors.
